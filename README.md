# Me in a nutshell
My name is Steve W Dames Jr. My first name stands for crown and humbly I accept the conotations also
associated with it. Chiefly, attributes of leadership I keep as the tenant of daily living. I believe
any great company is after the same thing--the best possible outcome for the recipient of the work enlisted. I want to 
be the Manager of a team of highly spirited and self motivated individuals who also believe in attaining
the best for the people we help.
